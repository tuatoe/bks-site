                        A group of Liberians residing in the US have established the Benjamin Karmon Sehkar Foundation Incorporated (BKS&trade;). The BKS&trade; Foundation, as it is affectionately known, has been established in memory of the late Benjamin K. Sehkar. Sehkar was a broadcast journalist killed in 1990 at the height of the Liberian Civil War by Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) soldiers during a popular uprising against the Samuel Kanyon Doe government. The Foundation was established with a focus on providing tuition assistance to disadvantaged and underprivileged children from rural Liberia, with Nimba County as the primary target for aid. BKS&trade; is headquartered in Monrovia, Liberia.

                    <h4>Our Mission</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our mission is to provide access to reliable, reasonable and quality education for children of underprivileged and disadvantage communities in Liberia. We are committed to providing educational opportunities to every child in Liberia regardless of the constraints, while teaching them the word of God.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Vision</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our vision is to realize a Liberia in which children from all over the country have equal access to quality education in this era of global competitiveness.

                        The BKS&trade; Foundation, Inc. provides scholarships to underprivileged and disadvantaged students to attend all major universities and colleges in Liberia. BKS&trade; Foundation is also partnering with some major high schools in the rural parts of the country to provide tuition assistance to students who meet its scholarship requirements. In addition to the aforementioned, we provide school supplies (notebooks, pencil, backpacks, crayons, rulers, etc.) to the disadvantaged students in Liberia.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <strong>BKS&trade; Legacy Scholarships</strong> are awarded to students from the Buu-Yao District who are currently enrolled at the following institutions: the Nimba County Community College, University of Liberia, Liberia International Christian College, Starz College of Science and Technology, and the United Methodist University. Qualified students from the Buu-Yao District who are intending to enroll at these universities will be awarded The BKS&trade; Legacy Scholarship. The Scholarship recipients are expected to complete annual service projects with young children and demonstrate leadership potential through involvement in school or community activities. Buu-Yao students at all levels of academic achievements may qualify for this grant. The selection process highlights an applicant's attitude toward education, willingness to provide service to children, and financial need.

                    <h2>Our Long-term Goal</h2>
                    <p>
                        We are committed to providing educational opportunities to the children of Liberia, regardless of the constraints, while teaching them the word of God. Our goal is to ensure that the children of the rural parts of Liberia receive quality education in safe, constructive, and well-staffed educational facilities. We will ensure that these future leaders are not individually, regionally or collectively left out of this fundamental human right, whether as a result of gender inequality, geographical location, policy, financial policy, human resources, or any other limitations.

                <p>Alvin Sehkar is an advocate for underprivileged education and a social entrepreneur from Liberia. Upon Mr. Alvin Sehkar's arrival to the United States in 2004, he made a promise to gratefully, proudly and gracefully tell his story. His has experienced the works and grace of God throughout his life. God manifested His will in his life and has brought him a long way. 
    Now, he feels obliged to give back to the people of Liberia. With that conviction, he established a foundation in his late father's name, the Benjamin Karmon Sehkar (BKS&trade;) Foundation, Inc. </p>  
                <p>
                After losing his father during the Liberian Civil war in the early 1990s, Alvin's family fled to the Ivory Coast to seek refuge. Growing up as a refugee in the Ivory Coast with a widowed mother, Sehkar and his siblings' lives were marked with poverty and hardship. Sometimes, his mother would have nothing to offer them, and they would go to sleep hungry without a meal. 
                </p>

                <p>
                Due to the hardship, and without financial Assistance or support, Sehkar withdrew from school on several occasions. Clothes and other basic human needs were scarce in their lives. Although Mr. Sehkar's early life was not easy, his faith in God remained constant during those tough times. With the help of a Catholic diocese in Kentucky, Alvin and his family had the opportunity to resettle in Owensboro, Kentucky. It was certainly a blessing, cultural shock and a life changing experience for them. 
                </p>

                <p>
                After seeing the countless blessings and opportunities this beautiful country (USA) has to offer, pursuing education was his next plan. He enrolled at Kentucky Wesleyan College in Owensboro, Kentucky. His reading, writing and speaking skills challenged his success. Again, his faith in God, hard work, perseverance, tenacity and determination took him through. Gratefully, Mr. Sehkar was able to complete his studies within four years. 
                </p>

                <p>
                After graduating from college in 2008, he relocated to Noblesville, Indiana. He enrolled at Anderson University, where he graduated with an MBA on May 11, 2013. Mr. Sehkar is currently employed at Capital Group in Carmel, Indiana.

                <p>
               What was expected to be a four-year journey eventually became an eight-year adventure as the Liberian civil war often truncated classes beginning his junior year. Upon graduation in 1995, Zeambo assumed his first pastorate, serving as assistant pastor, and later pastor, of a 350-member refugee congregation, the Liberian Refugee Fellowship in Danane, Ivory Coast.

               However, this newfound profession was short lived as Zeambo immigrated to the United States a year and a half later to further his studies. As he pursued graduated studies in Communications at Governors State University in Illinois, Zeambo ministered as assistant pastor at the Riverdale Baptist Church in neighboring Riverdale, a position he held faithfully for seven years.
